# KLVW Wallpaper

**KLVW** is an advanced Android wallpaper manager built for power users who want full, automated control over their home and lock screen wallpapers. It supports images and videos, automatic timed rotation, on-unlock cycling, a fully customisable floating popup menu, and a Quick Settings tile — all without requiring Tasker to function.

## How It Works

KLVW runs two persistent live wallpaper services — one for the home screen and one for the lock screen. All wallpaper actions (setting, rotating, restoring) funnel through a single repository that tracks the previous wallpaper so it can always be restored.

The **KLVW Popup Menu** is a floating overlay activity that can be launched by any app that can fire an Android intent — including QuikShort QS tiles, automation apps, or any shortcut launcher. Inside the popup you configure exactly which actions appear, in what order, and what they do.

---

## Setting Up the Popup Menu as a QS Tile (QuikShort)

The popup menu is triggered by firing the intent action:

```
com.klvw.wallpaper.POPUP
```

Use **[QuikShort](https://quikshort.atolphadev.com/docs/)** to create a Quick Settings tile that fires this intent:

1. Install [QuikShort](https://quikshort.atolphadev.com/docs/) from the Play Store.
2. Add a new QuikShort tile in your QS panel.
3. Configure the tile action as **Start Activity / Send Broadcast** using:
   - **Action:** `com.klvw.wallpaper.POPUP`
   - **Category:** `android.intent.category.DEFAULT`
   - **Package:** `com.klvw.wallpaper`
4. Label the tile (e.g. **KLVW Menu**) and save.

Pulling down your notification shade and tapping the tile will now open the KLVW popup overlay directly over whatever app or screen you are on.

> See the full QuikShort documentation at **https://quikshort.atolphadev.com/docs/** for details on intent configuration, tile icons, and advanced options.

## KLVW Popup Menu

### Adding and Configuring Items

Open the KLVW app → **Settings** → **KLVW Popup Menu** → **Add Item**.

Each item has a **Label** and one of the following **Action Types**:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Random Image** | Sets a random image from a selected folder (or the default image folder) to the chosen screen target |
| **Random Video** | Sets a random video from a selected folder (or the default video folder) to the chosen screen target |
| **Static Image** | Sets a specific saved image as the wallpaper for the chosen screen target |
| **Restore Previous** | Restores the wallpaper that was active before the last change |
| **Icon Color** | Forces status bar icons to Auto, Dark, or Light |
| **Select File** | Opens a file browser so you can pick any image or video from storage at runtime |
| **Timer Control** | Opens the wallpaper timer panel inside the popup |
| **All Folders** | Opens a panel to set the default source folder for all four targets at once |
| **Display Control** | Opens the on-unlock cycle control panel inside the popup |

For **Random Image** and **Random Video** items you can optionally pin them to a specific folder; leaving it blank uses the global default folder for that target.

For **Static Image** items, you first save images via the Wallpaper Picker screen, then select one from the list in the editor.

Items can be reordered (up/down arrows) and edited or deleted at any time.

### Screen Target

Actions that apply to a specific screen let you choose:
- **Home** — home screen only
- **Lock** — lock screen only
- **Both** — home and lock screen simultaneously

Actions that manage their own targets at runtime (Timer Control, All Folders, Display Control, Select File, Icon Color) do not show a target selector.

### Layout

- **List** — items shown in a scrollable vertical list
- **Grid** — items shown in a configurable grid (2 – 5 columns)

### Sizing

- **Popup Width** — Narrow / Medium / Wide (controls the width of the main popup card)
- **Auto-scale** — automatically sizes items to fill the popup width
- **Manual Item Size** — when auto-scale is off: XS / S / M / L / XL
- **Apply width to overlays** — independently apply the same popup width to each child overlay:
  - Icon Color Picker
  - Folder Selector
  - Timer Popup
  - All Folders Popup
  - Display Control Popup

## KLVW Quick Set Tile

A native Android Quick Settings tile that sets both home and lock screen wallpapers in a single tap, without opening the popup menu.

### Setup

The tile appears as **KLVW Quick Set** in your QS tile picker. Add it to your panel via **Settings → Notifications → Quick Settings**.

### Configuration (in-app)

Settings → **KLVW Quick Set Tile**

| Setting | Options |
|---|---|
| Home Screen action | Random Image · Random Video · Static Image |
| Lock Screen action | Random Image · Random Video · Static Image |
| Static image (home) | Pick from saved static images |
| Static image (lock) | Pick from saved static images |

For Random Image/Video the tile uses the default folders configured via the **All Folders** popup item or the **Display Control** screen.

### Kill Switch Mode

When **both** Home and Lock are set to **Static Image**, the tile becomes a global kill switch:

- **Tap** — applies the configured static wallpapers to both screens, then **disables all KLVW wallpaper functions** (timers, popup actions, display control all stop). The tile turns inactive.
- **Long press** (or tap while inactive) — opens a confirmation dialog. Tap **Yes** to re-enable everything and apply the tile action. Tap **No** to cancel.

This is useful when you want to freeze your wallpapers and prevent anything from changing them.

## Wallpaper Timers

Automatically rotate wallpapers on a schedule. Timers survive device sleep (AlarmManager-based) and restart after reboot.

### Access

Via the **Timer Control** popup item in the KLVW Popup Menu.

### Per-Target Timers

Four independent timers, each with its own enable switch, interval, and pause/resume control:

| Timer | Target |
|---|---|
| Home Image | Home screen — cycles random images |
| Home Video | Home screen — cycles random videos |
| Lock Image | Lock screen — cycles random images |
| Lock Video | Lock screen — cycles random videos |

### Intervals

5 min · 10 min · 15 min · 30 min · 45 min · 1 h · 2 h · 4 h · 8 h · 24 h

### Controls

- **Enable/Disable switch** — toggles the timer on or off
- **Pause / Resume** — suspends firing without changing the enabled state; the countdown stops and resumes from the current moment when unpaused
- **Countdown display** — shows the time remaining until the next wallpaper change for each active timer

Changing the interval takes effect immediately — the next alarm is rescheduled from that moment.

---

## Display Control

Automatically cycle to a new random wallpaper every time the screen is unlocked (user dismisses the lock screen).

### Setup

Settings → **KLVW Display Control**

#### Required Permissions

| Permission | Purpose | How to grant |
|---|---|---|
| Phone State | Read device call/screen state | Tap **Grant** in the section |
| Usage Access | Read app foreground state | Tap **Grant** → enable KLVW in Usage Access settings |
| Device Admin | Reliable lock-screen state detection | Tap **Grant** → enable KLVW Device Administrator |

#### On-Unlock Cycle Toggles

Enable each target independently:
- **Home Image** — cycles a random image to the home screen on unlock
- **Home Video** — cycles a random video to the home screen on unlock
- **Lock Image** — cycles a random image to the lock screen on unlock
- **Lock Video** — cycles a random video to the lock screen on unlock

The source folder for each target is the corresponding default folder (set via the **All Folders** popup item or the per-target folder selectors).

#### Reset Timer on Unlock

When any cycle toggle is active, two optional checkboxes appear:

- **Reset home timer on unlock** — when the home screen cycles on unlock, any running home timers are rescheduled from that moment (resets the countdown)
- **Reset lock timer on unlock** — same for lock screen timers

This keeps your timers in sync with your unlock behaviour — if you unlock and a new wallpaper is applied, the timer starts fresh so you don't get a second change moments later.

### Display Control in the Popup Menu

Add a **Display Control** item to your popup to access the same on-unlock toggles and timer-reset options without opening the main app.

---

## Folder Management

Settings → **Folders** tab (bottom navigation)

### Image Folders
Source folders for random image wallpapers. KLVW picks randomly from all images found inside the folder. You can add multiple folders; each appears in the popup editor's source folder list.

### Video Folders
Same as image folders but for video wallpapers.

### Adding a Folder
Tap **Add Image Folder** or **Add Video Folder** → pick a folder using the system folder picker → KLVW stores a persistent URI permission so it can read the folder after reboot without re-prompting.

### Deleting a Folder
Tap the delete icon next to any folder. This only removes it from KLVW's list; the actual folder and its files are untouched.

---

## Status Bar Icon Color

Independently from wallpaper setting, KLVW can force your status bar icons to a specific brightness mode.

**Settings → Status Bar Icons** or via the **Icon Color** popup menu item.

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Auto | Icons follow the wallpaper brightness (system default) |
| Dark | Icons are always dark (for light wallpapers) |
| Light | Icons are always light (for dark wallpapers) |

The Icon Color popup item lets you switch between modes directly from the floating popup or a QS tile.

---

## Popup Appearance

Settings → **Popup Appearance**

Customise the look of the popup card:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Background Color | Hex colour for the popup card background (leave blank for theme default) |
| Primary Text Color | Hex colour for item labels and headings |
| Secondary Text Color | Hex colour for subtitles and hints |

---

## Performance

Settings → **Performance**

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Vulkan GPU Rendering | Uses the Vulkan graphics API for hardware-accelerated wallpaper rendering. Disable if you experience visual glitches on older devices. |

---

## Tasker Integration

KLVW registers a broadcast receiver for the action `com.klvw.wallpaper.SET_WALLPAPER`. You can use Tasker's **Send Intent** action to set a wallpaper by folder name:

| Extra | Value |
|---|---|
| `folder_name` | Name of a registered folder (supports Tasker variables e.g. `%KLVWFOLDER`) |
| `target` | `home` · `lock` · `both` |
| `type` | `image` · `video` (optional, defaults to image) |

> In Tasker: New Task → + → Plugin → **KLVW Wallpaper** to use the plugin action instead of a raw Send Intent.

---

## Requirements

- Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher
- KLVW set as the live wallpaper via **Settings → Live Wallpaper → Activate Live Wallpaper**
- Storage permission (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_MEDIA_VIDEO on Android 13+)
- SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission for the popup overlay (prompted on first use)
